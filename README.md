This repository contains the solutions for the MATLAB companion course in Financial Econometrics. All scrips are in the MLX format presented in class. These scrips are divided into four sections:

  - MATLAB Review;
  - Time Series Modelling;
  - Volatility Modelling;
  - Value-at-Risk Modelling.

### Dependencies
This part of the course relies heavily on using functions from the MFE toolbox. Please download this toolbox [here](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/code/matlab/mfe-toolbox/#current-version) if you haven't done so already.
